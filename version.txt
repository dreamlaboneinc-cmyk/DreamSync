If this file is changed, that means my pushbot and update server app commands are working.
This edit was dome  in cursor,
then was saved,
then pushed by pushbot to github
then i went to ssh and ran updatebot DreamSync
and all the files seem to be in tact broski! 
I wonder if that also means my DreamSync app is working?
the bridge and all the other files?
Godspeed, 
Its th AGE of AI bro!
